##  Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a **comprehensive data analysis workflow** on e-commerce transaction data, covering the **entire analytics pipeline** — from data cleaning to statistical analysis, visualization, predictive modeling, and SQL-based exploration in **Google Sheets**.  

The goal was to uncover actionable insights into **customer purchasing behavior**, **sales trends**, and **market opportunities**.

---

##  Excel Workbook Breakdown  

### **1. Customer Data (Raw)**  
**Purpose:** Initial dataset containing unprocessed transactional data.  
**Key Columns:** Invoice, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Price, Customer ID, Country  

**Data Issues Identified:**
- Duplicate records  
- Cancelled orders (Invoices with ‘C’ prefix)  
- Missing customer IDs and descriptions  
- Postage/refund transactions  
- Unformatted Excel date serials  

---

### **2. Clean Data**  
**Purpose:** Transformed dataset ready for analysis.  

**Cleaning Operations:**
- Removed duplicates and cancelled orders  
- Filtered out postage, refunds, and zero-value transactions  
- Converted Excel date serials → readable datetime  
- Created calculated columns: **Revenue** and **Time (hour bins)**  

**Final Dataset:** 45 valid transactions  

---

### **3. Exploring Data Numerically**  
**Purpose:** Statistical exploration and relationship analysis.  

| Metric | Value | Insight |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Total Price** | \$116.85 | Total revenue from clean transactions |
| **Average Price** | \$3.20 | Average item cost |
| **Median Price** | \$2.60 | Consistent price distribution |
| **Price Range** | \$0.55 – \$12.75 | Healthy product diversity |

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Price ↔ Quantity: **-0.139** (weak negative relationship)  
- Invoice Date ↔ Price: **0.108** (very weak positive relationship)

---

### **4. Exploring Data Visually**  
**Purpose:** Visual analysis using Excel pivot charts and aggregated summaries.  

**Key Insights:**
- **Peak Hour:** 11 AM – 12 PM (highest daily sales)  
- **Top Market:** United Kingdom (≈95% revenue share)  
- **Top Product:** “ASSORTED COLOUR BIRD ORNAMENT” (~\$1,160 revenue)  
- **Customer Distribution:** 87% UK-based, 13% international

### **5. Model Data (Linear Regression)**  
**Objective:** Examine the price–quantity relationship to understand demand patterns.  

**Regression Formula:**
Price = -0.0029 × Quantity + 3.31

**Interpretation:**  
Indicates a **weak negative correlation**, supporting the **demand curve principle** — higher quantity tends to associate with slightly lower prices.

## Key Business Insights  

### **Strengths**
- Strong UK market presence and consistent customer engagement  
- Clear **peak-hour sales patterns** for operational optimization  
- High-performing **home & kitchen categories**  
- Well-defined customer purchasing trends  

### **Opportunities**
- **Geographic Expansion:** Grow presence in France, Germany, and other European markets  
- **Time-Based Marketing:** Focus promotions during **11 AM – 12 PM** peak window  
- **Product Diversification:** Expand top-performing categories  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Tailor offers for **domestic vs international** audiences

## SQL Queries (in Google Sheets)

Executed SQL-like queries using **Google Sheets QUERY function** for data exploration:

| Query Type | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| `SELECT ... WHERE` | Filter transactions by product, country, or date |
| `ORDER BY` & `LIMIT` | Sort and extract top-performing products |
| `GROUP BY` | Aggregate sales by country or product |
| `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` | Calculate key performance metrics |
| Conditional expressions | Analyze filtered patterns and KPIs |
