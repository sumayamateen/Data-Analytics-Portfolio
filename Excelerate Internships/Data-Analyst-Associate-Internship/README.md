## Overview
This project involves creating a **centralized Master Table** by integrating multiple educational datasets and building a **stakeholder-facing dashboard**.  
The workflow includes **ETL, mapping table creation, dashboard wireframing**, and **visual storytelling**.

**Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL, SQL, Google Looker Studio, Excel, PDF

---

## Problem Statement
- Multiple disparate datasets (Cognito, User Data, Learner Opportunity, Cohort Data, Opportunity Data) made trend analysis and engagement tracking difficult.  
- A **centralized dashboard** was needed for better decision-making.

---

## Project Files
- `1_Master_Table_ETL.sql` → SQL scripts to build the Master Table  
- `1_Marketing_Data_ETL.sql` → SQL for Marketing dataset (analyzed separately)  
- `2_Mapping_Table.xlsx` → Documented relationships and transformations across datasets  
- `3_Wireframe_Sketch.pdf` → Planned dashboard layout and design  
- `Presentation.pdf` → Stakeholder-facing presentation summarizing workflow, insights, and recommendations  

---

## ETL & Data Processing
- Integrated five datasets into a **unified Master Table**  
- Applied **data cleaning**: trimming, casing standardization, null handling, mode/average imputation  
- Conducted **data quality checks** (null audits, sample verification, format validation)  
- Implemented **indexing** for optimized query performance  
- Marketing dataset analyzed independently due to lack of relational links  

---

## Deliverables & Insights
- **Master Table:** Clean, structured dataset ready for analysis  
- **Mapping Table:** Relationships and transformations documented  
- **Wireframe:** Planned dashboard layout for storytelling  
- **Dashboard:** Interactive visualizations in Looker Studio  
- **Presentation:** Insights, KPIs, and recommendations summarized  

### Key Insights
- Consolidation improved analysis efficiency  
- Dashboard visualizations highlighted learner engagement trends  
- Insights support data-driven interventions and course restructuring
