## Overview
This project consolidates **multiple educational datasets** into a **centralized Master Table** and builds an **interactive dashboard** for stakeholders.  
The workflow includes **ETL, data cleaning, mapping table creation, dashboard wireframing**, and **visual storytelling**.

**Tech Stack:** 
- PostgreSQL
- Google Looker Studio
-  Excel

---

## Problem Statement
- Disparate datasets (Cognito, User Data, Learner Opportunity, Cohort Data, Opportunity Data) made it difficult to track trends and learner engagement.  
- Monitoring program and campaign effectiveness required a **centralized, interactive dashboard** for decision-making.

## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1.1_Master_Table_ETL.sql` | SQL scripts to build the Master Table from multiple raw datasets |
| `1.2_Marketing_Data_ETL.sql` | SQL scripts for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the Marketing dataset separately |
| `2_Mapping_Table.xlsx` | Documented relationships and transformations across datasets |
| `3_Wireframe_Sketch.pdf` | Planned dashboard layout, design, and visualization flow |
| `Presentation.pdf` | Stakeholder-facing presentation summarizing workflow, key insights, and recommendations |

## ETL & Data Processing
- Integrated **five datasets** into a **unified Master Table**  
- Applied **data cleaning**: trimming, casing standardization, null handling, mode/average imputation  
- Conducted **data quality checks**: null audits, sample verification, format validation  
- Implemented **indexing** for optimized query performance  
- Marketing dataset analyzed independently due to lack of relational links

## Dashboard
[Interactive Excelerate Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/2f96741e-e9c4-4b02-8b94-6f8547626f7a)  
- Visualizes **learner reach, engagement trends, growth, and campaign performance**  

---

## Key Insights
- Consolidation improved analysis efficiency and reduced manual tracking  
- Dashboard visualizations highlighted **learner engagement trends** and **campaign performance**  
- Peak engagement in 2023, followed by decline in 2024–2025 → insights inform interventions  
- Campaign drop-offs identified (clicks → views mismatch) for optimization  
- Regional engagement differences indicate opportunities for **targeted expansion**  

---

## Recommendations
1. **Address Learner Application Drop-off (Post-2024):** Investigate decline causes and optimize campaigns  
2. **Optimize Campaign Performance:** Improve landing pages to reduce bounce/drop-off rates  
3. **Regional Expansion:** Focus on South America, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia for better engagement equity  
4. **Data-Driven Interventions:** Use insights to restructure courses and enhance engagement  

---

## Conclusion
The **Excelerate Master Table & Dashboard** consolidates fragmented datasets into a **unified, insightful analytics tool**, enabling stakeholders to:  
- Make data-driven decisions  
- Track learner engagement and program effectiveness  
- Optimize campaigns and improve global educational impact  

With implementation of the recommendations, Excelerate can **enhance learner experience and operational efficiency** further.
